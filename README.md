# Intent Studio

**Design AI agents with product taste, not code.**

Intent Studio is a single-page web app that helps product people create structured AI agent specifications (Intent Capsules) from plain-language descriptions.

## What It Does

Describe what you want an AI agent to do in natural language, and Intent Studio generates a complete Intent Capsule with:

- 🎯 **Objective** — The problem and why it matters
- ✅ **Desired Outcomes** — Observable success states
- 📊 **Health Metrics** — What must NOT degrade
- 🧭 **Strategic Context** — Business, technical, and user considerations
- 🚧 **Constraints** — Steering guidelines and hard limits
- 🤖 **Decision Autonomy** — What the agent can do vs. when to escalate
- 🛑 **Stop Rules** — When to complete, escalate, or halt
- 🔧 **Implementation Notes** — Practical next steps

## Features

- **Zero dependencies** — Pure HTML/CSS/JS, works offline
- **Mobile-first** — Optimized for iPhone 14 Pro and all devices
- **Smart templating** — Extracts keywords from your input to generate contextual capsules
- **Export options** — Copy to clipboard or download as Markdown
- **Beautiful design** — Dark theme with gradient accents and glass morphism

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
2. Describe your AI agent idea in the text area
3. Click "Generate Intent"
4. Copy or export your Intent Capsule

## Design Philosophy

Built by a 20-year product veteran who believes AI agents should be designed with product taste, not just technical specs. Intent Capsules bridge the gap between product vision and implementation.

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML5
- CSS3 (with backdrop-filter for glass morphism)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Mobile-responsive with safe-area-inset support
